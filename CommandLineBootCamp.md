# Unleashing the power of the command line

This covers some of what Masa did before and then adds some.

## Log onto server

Reminder: our server runs on a Linux operating system. The following commands are to 'interact' with that operating system and do NOT work on Windows. Most will work exactly the same on a Mac.

    $ ssh username@fgcz-c-047.uzh.ch

## Unix commands

By default, the server uses bash (Bourne Again SHell) to interpret your commands to tell the computer what to do. 

### `man` pages

These are (usually) good resources for the commands we will run. They include the arguments the unix command expects and what other options are available.

    $ man pwd
    $ man less
    
Once the man page is open, you can use `d` for page down and `u` for page up. Type `q` to exit page back to command line prompt.

Google the command and you will find numerous examples of how to use the command plus its various options to do the exact thing you want it to do.
